-----------------------------------------------

Nothing is stored by the app locally beyond the session where you've got it open. I've got zero backend servers for this, so I don't store any of your data there either!

We send your lat/long data to
- http://api.postcodes.io/
- http://www.uk-postcodes.com/
- https://www.geonames.org/

All of these are for the purposes of getting your postcode as you might expect. There are no trackers, ads or anything other than the postcode code in here, although reading https://github.com/palfrey/postcode and compiling your own copy is suggested for the paranoid.
